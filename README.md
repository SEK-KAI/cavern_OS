# cavern_OS

//------------------------------------------------------//

This is a small test of an operating system I'm building

It will become more fleshe out as time goes on.

Please pardon my dust

//------------------------------------------------------//


To use the mini OS:

simply clone the repo, and run the compiled file

if you are having issues, run the cavernous.py to preload certain assets

this can be done by running 'python cavernous.py' in the root folder for the python script

eg:

cd /user/downloads/cavern_OS-master/

python cavernous.py

it might take time to unpackage and may exit when finished
