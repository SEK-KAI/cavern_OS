# cavern_OS

//------------------------------------------------------//

This is a small test of an operating system I'm building

It will become more fleshe out as time goes on.

Please pardon my dust

//------------------------------------------------------//


To use the mini OS:

simply clone the repo, and run the compiled file

if you are having issues, run the cavernous.py to preload certain assets
